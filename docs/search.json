It features several examples and interactive elements that guide students through core concepts and provide engaging ways to explore the material.\n\n\nGenerative Art\n\n\nTwirl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinwheel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrispy\n\n\n\n\n\nCalories Consumed vs Plate Size Violin & Box Plot\nThe plot compares total calories consumed across different plate sizes (small and large) based on a study exploring whether people eat more when served on larger plates. It uses violin and box plots to show the distribution and average consumption of calories for each group.\n\n\n\nCorrelation Matrix of Electricity Consumption Data\nThis is a correlation matrix of data from US electricity producers in 1955. The variables are cost (total cost), output (total output), labor (wage rate), laborshare (cost share for labor), capital (capital price index), capitalshare (costshare for capital), fuel (fuel price), and fuelshare (cost share for fuel). Variables with a strong, positive correlation are more green, and variables with a strong, negative correlation are more orange.\n\n\n\nScatter Plot of Median Family Income VS Cost of School\nThe CollegeScores dataset contains information on US colleges and university, including variables like the name, median family income ($), and average total cost to attend ($). The scatterplot shows the relationship between median family income and the average total cost to attend, with Bucknell University highlighted in orange, while other schools are in blue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nIntroduction\nMovies have long been a major part of entertainment throughout the world, shaping trends and influencing audiences with their financial success, often reflecting their cultural impact. We will explore the top 1,000 highest-grossing Hollywood movies as of January 2020, sourced from IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes. Focusing on distributors with at least 90 movies in this list, we will examine their box office performance and analyze Disney’s dominance compared to other studios. We will also explore key factors such as runtime, movie rating, and worldwide box office sales to gain deeper insights into the success of these films.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 Movies by World Sales\nTo understand Disney’s dominance, let’s start by looking at the top 10 highest-grossing movies of all time as of 2020, over half of which were released by Disney. Disney’s box office success can be attributed to its iconic animation, as well as its wildly successful franchises like Pixar, Star Wars, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\n\n\nBox Office Sales Trends Over Time\nNext, let’s explore the total annual annual box office sales by distributor, highlighting how Disney and other major distributors have performed over the years. Disney’s dominance is immediately clear: a close second from 2010 to 2011, a close third in 2012, first place in 2013, slipped to third in 2014, and nearly reclaimed first in 2015. From 2016 to 2019, Disney led each year by over a billion dollars in annual sales, with an extraordinary lead of $8 billion over the second-place studio in 2019.\n\n\n\nAverage World Sales by Distributor\nNext, we’ll look at the average world sales by distributor to see which studios tend to generate the highest box office revenue per movie. Again, Disney is leading in this metric as well with an average of around $540 million in box office sales per movie.\n\n\n\nBox Office Performance by Rating\nWe’ve established the overall success of Disney’s movie studios, but what type of audience do Disney movies appeal to? By examining how the box office revenue is distributed across different movies ratings (G, PG, PG-13, R), we can compare the performance of family-friendly films against more mature-rated films across studios.\n\n\n\nBox Office Performance by Runtime\nWe can also break down box office performance by runtime, offering insights into the lengths of movies studios release and their financial success. By examining the differences in revenue across various runtime groups, we can investigate whether there is a correlation between movie length and box office success.\n\n\n\nNumber of Movies Released by Distributor\nIn addition to sales, it’s important to consider the number of movies released by each distributor, as shown in the visualization below. Disney releases a significant number of movies, second only to Warner Bros, yet they consistently lead in average box office performance, with many of their films turning into financial hits.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nDisney’s box office dominance is undeniable. The studio consistently generates high box office returns across a vast number of films, including many of the highest-grossing movies of all time, highlighting its global impact. Disney’s broad appeal spans diverse audiences, solidifying its position as the undisputed leader in the industry.\n\n\n\n",
