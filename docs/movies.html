Disney’s box office success can be attributed to its iconic animation, as well as its wildly successful franchises like Pixar, Star Wars, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>

<h1 id="box-office-sales-trends-over-time">Box Office Sales Trends Over Time</h1>
<p>Next, let’s explore the total annual annual box office sales by distributor, highlighting how Disney and other major distributors have performed over the years. Disney’s dominance is immediately clear: a close second from 2010 to 2011, a close third in 2012, first place in 2013, slipped to third in 2014, and nearly reclaimed first in 2015. From 2016 to 2019, Disney led each year by over a billion dollars in annual sales, with an extraordinary lead of $8 billion over the second-place studio in 2019.</p>

<h1 id="average-world-sales-by-distributor">Average World Sales by Distributor</h1>
<p>Next, we’ll look at the average world sales by distributor to see which studios tend to generate the highest box office revenue per movie. Again, Disney is leading in this metric as well with an average of around $540 million in box office sales per movie.</p>

<h1 id="box-office-performance-by-rating">Box Office Performance by Rating</h1>
<p>We’ve established the overall success of Disney’s movie studios, but what type of audience do Disney movies appeal to? By examining how the box office revenue is distributed across different movies ratings (G, PG, PG-13, R), we can compare the performance of family-friendly films against more mature-rated films across studios.</p>

<h1 id="box-office-performance-by-runtime">Box Office Performance by Runtime</h1>
<p>We can also break down box office performance by runtime, offering insights into the lengths of movies studios release and their financial success. By examining the differences in revenue across various runtime groups, we can investigate whether there is a correlation between movie length and box office success.</p>
